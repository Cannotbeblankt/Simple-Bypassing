	<h1>I Quite Hate Securly!</h1>
	<p>So we gotta bypass it somehow, and I know just the thing
		we use a proxy.</p>
	<h2>But How Do We Do It?</h2>
	<p>It's simple, find a proxy link that isn't blocked.</p>
	<p>Easiest way is to go onto TikTok and search up "unblocked games",
		and keep scrolling until you find a link that works.</p>
	<h2>What If No Link Works?</h2>
	<p>Okay, then you make your own link using sub-domains.</p>
	<h3> What Is A Subdomain?</h3>
	<p>A sub-domain is a website used by one single domain.
		Basically it's a domain within a domain, and you can make sub-domains
		by using the websites IP, and you can use FreeDNS to make your very own
		sub-domains.</p>
